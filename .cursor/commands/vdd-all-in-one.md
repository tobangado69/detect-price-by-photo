# /vdd-all-in-one Command

Alias for `/vdd-build` - Build a complete application or feature using Vertical Driven Development (VDD) principles.

## Usage

```
/vdd-all-in-one [feature-name] [description] [--implement]
```

This is the same as `/vdd-build`. See [vdd-build.mdc](vdd-build.mdc) for full documentation.

## Quick Examples

```
/vdd-all-in-one blog-platform "Full blog with posts, categories, and comments"
/vdd-all-in-one task-manager "Task management with projects, tasks, and assignments" --implement
```

## What It Does

Combines SDD full-plan workflow (`/sdd-full-plan` or `/pecut-all-in-one`) with VDD principles:
- Identifies vertical slices from business requirements
- Creates complete SDD workflow for each slice
- Organizes by business features, not technical layers
- Can implement everything in one go

See `/vdd-build` command for complete documentation.
